       "                                        CNBC spoke to four former Theranos employees about the upcoming trial of embattled CEO Elizabeth Holmes.Micah Nies, a customer service manager said, “there was always this fear of retribution and afterward you carry it with you.”“Most are anxious for it to be over,” said another former Theranos employee who may be called to testify.The former employees feel there’s “an unspoken bond” between them. He was the father of newborn twins who wanted to make a difference in healthcare.Now, with Elizabeth Holmes’ criminal fraud trial set to begin Tuesday, Micah Nies is tired of “being siloed” and is breaking his silence.Nies is one of four former Theranos employees interviewed by CNBC ahead of Holmes’ trial. The others, who did not want their names used, say they are still afraid of retribution from Holmes and former Theranos president, Sunny Balwani.“The fear is real,” Nies said. “Even several years later. The atmosphere was so toxic you would hear the stories of people being disappeared. There was always this fear of retribution and afterward you carry it with you.” Holmes and Balwani have pled not guilty to a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. Balwani’s trial won’t take place until next year. Attorneys for Holmes and Balwani did not return requests for comment.Nies was hired at Theranos in March 2015 for $185,000 a year to be the senior manager of customer service and call center operations at the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., according to an acceptance letter he shared with CNBC. Theranos recruited him at age 41 from another healthcare company in San Diego.He reported directly to Balwani, who he called “the king manipulator.” His job was to solve problems but he said he soon realized the real problem was Theranos itself.“There was always something fishy or peculiar going on,” Nies said. “It was very clear they were trying to hide something. Every morning I woke up and wondered what they were going to spin today, while I was trying to find my exit strategy.”Another employee who worked at Theranos, who quit after it became apparent the company was what she calls a “house of cards,” asked not to be named in fear of Holmes and Balwani retaliating.Reflecting on the upcoming trial, which has been repeatedly delayed, the former employee says she feels “sad to witness such an epic failure of proper due diligence on the part of so many people, but it’s also very predictable.”Asked what she would tell Holmes today, she said: “You’re not dealing with someone who deals in reality. So the point of having a conversation starts to diminish in the face of someone who just sees things how they want the world to be.”The former employees interviewed by CNBC all said they left the company disillusioned and distraught over what happened, but don’t want their careers defined by this ordeal. They each arrived at Theranos with different perspectives, but looking back say their views are crystal clear about what went on inside the company.“I wouldn’t be surprised if either one of them turned into ‘War of the Roses,’” Nies said referring to the 1989 movie where a married couple battles over a nasty divorce. “He’s got more desperation in the sense of money and she’s got a life to look forward to now that she’s trying to recreate. The recipe is there for a blame game.”Whether Holmes will take the stand in her own defense remains unknown. Former employees said that damage control was routine at Theranos and all agreed that Holmes is innately optimistic.“That’s what she was good at,” Nies said. “We would get bad news and the next day she would hold a town hall and everybody’s eyes would glaze over. She’s very charismatic in the sense that she knows how to talk to people.”And that charisma was on public display in 2015 on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” The day after the Wall Street Journal published an explosive report about the Theranos blood-testing technology not working as advertised, Holmes appeared on the program to defend her company. “This is what happens when you work to change things,” Holmes told host Jim Cramer. “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, then you change the world.”Nies, who left Theranos after just one year, stays in touch with some of his former colleagues. He says they “just want to put it in the rear view mirror. Hopefully they find her guilty, Sunny too, and we all just move on. But a lot of us are skeptical that’ll happen since she’s part of this elite group.”Another high-level employee, who asked not to be named because he may be called to testify as a witness, said he feels “it’s taken a long time, we were really hoping this would be done sooner. Most of us who worked there are anxious for it to be over.”And a former Theranos executive who was close to Holmes told CNBC, “It didn’t have to end this way. She could have chosen any number of off-ramps and changed the trajectory of the company. But like the movie Speed, she would never take her foot off the gas pedal.”The long-awaited trial, which will be one of the most watched financial fraud cases in recent history, is bringing back a rush of emotions for those who also believed they could make a difference.“There’s definitely an unspoken bond between all of us, we went through it together,” Nies said. “Those of us who left Theranos before it all crumbled down, we’re on the other side of it now with good careers. It’s cathartic to speak about.”\n",

       "                                        CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday that recently reopened schools that are already struggling with large-scale Covid outbreaks generally aren’t following federal guidelines that recommend students and staff wear masks indoors and get vaccinated when eligible.Pediatric Covid hospitalizations in the U.S. reached their highest reported levels this week, and Walensky school closures will occur in districts with insufficient safeguards to block community spread of the virus. Speaking at a White House Covid-19 briefing, Walensky called on schools to adopt a multi-layered approach that also includes social distancing, enhanced ventilation and Covid testing to prevent outbreaks in schools.“I want to strongly appeal to those districts who have not implemented prevention strategies and encourage them to do the right thing to protect the children under their care,” Walensky said.

Abbott to deploy 2,500 more out-of-state medical staff to battle delta Covid surge Walensky, who didn’t call out any school districts by name, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied an outbreak in Northern California where an unvaccinated, symptomatic teacher read unmasked to a class and caused an outbreak among students, staff and their families. And in Florida, Hillsborough County Public Schools reported this month that nearly 10,400 students and almost 340 staff were in isolation or quarantine after close contact with a positive Covid case.The CDC also studied Covid measures in Los Angeles County, where prevention strategies kept the rate of cases in schools lower than the rate of cases in the county. Walensky added that the CDC has seen increased pediatric Covid cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks, driven by the increased transmissibility of the delta variant.“Schools should implement as many of these prevention layers as possible simultaneously, and this serves to protect our children, even if there are inevitable breaches in any single layer,” Walensky said.\n",

       "                                        The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic force that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until being toppled by U.S. forces in 2001, entered the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday after sweeping through much of the country in recent days following a withdrawal of U.S. troops. The group that sheltered Osama bin Laden as he planned the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America is now consolidating control over the country as they end two decades of fighting in Afghanistan.\n",
       "Who are the Taliban? The Taliban were founded in southern Afghanistan by Mullah Mohammad Omar, a member of the Pashtun tribe who became a mujahedeen commander that helped push the Soviets out of the country in 1989. In 1994, Mullah Omar formed the group in Kandahar with about 50 followers who rose up to challenge the instability, corruption and crime that consumed Afghanistan during the post-Soviet-era civil war.\n",
       "The Taliban, whose name means “students”—a reference to the founding members having studied under Mullah Omar—quickly captured Kandahar and seized the capital, Kabul, in 1996 as Afghans grew disenchanted with the country’s insecurity. The Taliban swiftly imposed strict Islamic rules that banned television and music, barred girls from going to school and forced women to wear head-to-toe coverings called burqas. The Taliban provided bin Laden with sanctuary while he planned the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n",
       "When the Taliban refused U.S. demands that they hand over bin Laden, American forces invaded Afghanistan and quickly toppled Mullah Omar’s government. Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders found sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan while they mounted an insurgent campaign to regain power in Afghanistan. In February 2020, the U.S. and the Taliban signed a historic deal that laid out a 14-month timetable for America to withdraw all of its forces from Afghanistan. In the interim, talks between the Taliban and Afghan government meant to end the war gained little traction.\n",
       "What are the Taliban fighting for? The Taliban aim to reimpose their strict version of Islam across Afghanistan. Taliban leaders say they want to create an inclusive government that won’t be a threat to the West, but the group has reimposed its harsh rule in parts of the country where it secured control earlier in the conflict.\n",

       "                                        By Reuters Staff8 Min Read(Adds quotes)Aug 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy continues to make progress towards the Federal Reserve’s benchmarks for reducing its pandemic-era emergency programs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday, in remarks that defended the view current high inflation will likely pass and stopped short of signaling the timing for any policy shift.STORY:STATEMENT:MARKET REACTION:STOCKS: The S&P 500 hit a record highBONDS: The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield extended a dropFOREX: The dollar index fellCOMMENTS:DAVID PETROSINELLI, SENIOR TRADER, INSPEREX, NEW YORK:“I think the market liked it and they liked it because its part and parcel of this wait and see approach that Powell has adopted…I think generally speaking what he basically did is he probably pushed out the explicit announcement and commencement of tapering into November, because there is the September meeting and after that is November and I think they want to announce it at a Fed meeting, so I think basically what he did is effectively push it off to later in the fourth quarter rather than at the end of the third quarter in September.”“He also was very clear to detach tapering from “the rate liftoff” or raising rates… I think he wants to make sure to condition the market to not expect that the beginning of tapering means the onset of a Fed tightening cycle sooner rather than later, he was very clear to delineate that.”ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, DEUTSCHE BANK“I think he gave himself maximum flexibility.”“When it all comes out in the wash this doesn’t really change anything in terms of expected taper.”“The taper will probably be flagged in September.”“The biggest concern I would have is if the Fed is wrong on inflation being temporary and they have to put the brakes on sooner than expected.”“This takes away from immediate dollar upside but the ultimate dollar upside story still focuses on interest rates.”HINESH PATEL, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT QUILTER INVESTORS, LONDON, IN EMAILED COMMENTS“Powell’s speech is evidence that central banks are looking beyond the surge in Delta cases globally.”“Powell has been incredibly clear that tapering is coming later this year and they should now be prepared enough to avoid any sort of tantrum. But central banks will have to ultimately hold the hands of financial markets as we transition to a new era of monetary policy to ensure credit conditions remain optimal.”SIMON HARVEY, SENIOR FX MARKET ANALYST, MONEX EUROPE“In the FX space, the dollar’s downturn occurred around 5 minutes before Powell’s speech was released, with the greenback’s losses extending once headlines came in and front-end yields plummeted. More accommodative Fed policy looks to be on the horizon as long as Covid continues to linger over the US economic recovery, and the classic adage of “bad news is good news” rings out for markets amid this environment.”KARL SCHAMOTTA, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL PRODUCT AND MARKET STRATEGY, CAMBRIDGE GLOBAL PAYMENTS, TORONTO“With one hand Powell giveth, and with the other, taketh away. The Fed Chair’s comments suggest the central bank could begin tapering asset purchases this year, but interest rate hikes remain a distant and uncertain prospect.”“The dollar is tumbling as market participants sharply lower expectations for the Fed’s long-term tightening trajectory. By suggesting a “different and substantially more stringent test” must be met before rates rise, and that disinflationary pressures will resume once the “pandemic passes into history”, Powell is dropping a hammer on the middle of the interest rate curve and compelling traders to search for yield in foreign markets.”GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK“I think the message is clear for Treasuries -- it’s status quo and watch the data. Really, the data over the next month or two will determine the actions the Fed takes. So if we get a very strong payrolls report for example next month it could suggest that tapering could happen sooner. If the data starts to moderate, and not just the payrolls -- on inflation, on activity -- we could actually see the Fed move a little bit later. It’s more of a question of when not if. We know tapering is coming, it’s just a question of when that tapering will become appropriate.”ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK“Very anticipated commentary today… not going to announce the exact cadence or timing but we’re certainly going to hear that we’ve made substantial progress and that this year is when we kick (taper) off. Markets are getting exactly what they anticipated and therefore trying to claw back from yesterday’s losses. This has been a very transparent Fed and we’ve heard a lot about the potential for tapering of asset purchases and today is pretty much as we expected.”“Powell has done a very good job of not surprising us. We’ve been talking about (tapering) for a bit. Most Fed speakers have made it a part of their conversation and that’s taking out the surprise out of the tantrum. It removes the potential for a tantrum. It is a very well telegraphed move and that sort of alleviates any pressure of surprising markets.”“(Tapering) will probably (be announced) in the September meeting and they’ll probably kick it off in November and it will likely be wrapped up in the first half of next year.”“They are likely to raise interest rates in the back half of 2022. It’ll certainly be as very well telegraphed as the taper has been. They’ll start talking about interest rate changes in the mid-year, when they would have wrapped up tapering at that juncture.”MICHAEL BROWN, SENIOR ANALYST, CAXTON, LONDON“I think it was a little bit of a damp squib to be honest, especially given that the market had been so eagerly anticipating Jackson Hole for months. The remarks were, broadly, a repeat of the July FOMC minutes, though with the language around tapering still heavily caveated.”“Powell has, simply, punted to September, at which point we may get more of a firm signal on how tapering will pan out, though the lack of any firm nod to tapering today means a September taper announcement is highly unlikely.”“The (FX) market has interpreted Powell’s remarks as a little more dovish than expected, though I think there is plenty ‘selling the fact’ going on, after a week of building up hawkish positions.”KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH“Powell understands that tapering will happen, but it’s not going to happen sooner than later. He’s going to make sure that full employment comes back before taking those steps.”“Even though a lot of the other Fed presidents have come out and said ‘we’re going to do this sooner rather than later, prudent Powell is going to make sure that the economy really is healed. You don’t want to make people carsick when you’re driving an economy.”JOHN DOYLE, VICE PRESIDENT OF DEALING AND TRADING, TEMPUS INC., WASHINGTON“It appears the speech was a bit more dovish than some had expected.”“Powell said that tapering could be appropriate “this year.” Except we already knew that. Minutes from the last Fed meeting showed that “most” participants favored tapering this year. Powell did not indicate tapering would being next month as some expected, hence the “dovish” label.”“If easing stays in place longer, that is good for stocks and bad for the dollar so the market moves all make sense so far.” (Reporting by Reuters markets team)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

       "                                        Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel said Friday it’s important for people to keep wearing face coverings until a larger percentage of the U.S. population has received a Covid vaccine.The former Obama health advisor told CNBC he’s concerned about people who are not yet vaccine eligible, such as those under the age of 12.Emanuel questioned why some 12- to 15-year-olds, who are eligible, are “not accessing it.” Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel told CNBC on Friday he believes it’s important for people to keep wear face coverings, especially in schools, until a larger percentage of the U.S. population has received a Covid vaccine.In an interview on “Squawk Box,” the former Obama health advisor said he wasn’t advocating for “permanent masks” in society. Rather, he said he remains concerned about those who aren’t eligible yet to get the vaccine: children under the age of 12.Once more kids are able to get a Covid shot and additional adults are vaccinated, “then you’re going to have the situation where the virus will be dying out because there won’t be any vulnerable people. That’s the place we want to be. We’re far from that place,” said Emanuel, who currently serves as vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania.“When we’re far from that place, we need to vaccinate people. We need to wear masks. We need to improve the ventilation in school. All that’s doable, and all that can make going to school much safer and make parents at ease,” added Emanuel, who was a health policy advisor for the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. He also advised President Joe Biden’s transition team on the Covid pandemic.Roughly 52% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against Covid, while about 61% has had at least one dose, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those eligible for the vaccine — those age 12 and up —nearly 61% are fully immunized and 71.5% have had at least one dose.Those percentages are not adequate to really rein in the pandemic in the U.S., Emanuel said. To improve coronavirus vaccine uptake, Emanuel suggested the U.S. impose a nationwide mandate. While that seems unlikely to actually happen, Biden administration officials have, in recent days, stepped up pressure on companies to institute employee vaccination requirements now that the Food and Drug Administration fully approved the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.“Why do we have this extremely effective intervention and roughly half the population not using it? Some of them are not eligible, but there are plenty of people in the country, as I mentioned among young adolescents, 12- to 15-year-olds, that are eligible but not accessing it,” Emanuel said.The FDA’s full approval of the Pfizer’s vaccine is for people ages 16 and older. The vaccine was cleared for those ages 12 to 15 in May on an emergency use basis, while trials are underway for children younger than that.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told NBC News earlier this week the company expects to have data on kids ages 5 to 11 in September, which it would then submit to the FDA.Moderna, which like Pfizer makes a two-dose mRNA vaccine, filed for full FDA approval in June. The biotech firm’s application remains under consideration. Johnson & Johnson has not yet applied for full regulatory clearance for its single-shot Covid vaccine.\n",

       "                                        In 2018, a young legal scholar named Lina Khan published an essay in the Journal of European Competition Law & Practice titled “The New Brandeis Movement: America’s Antimonopoly Debate.” She defined the core beliefs of an inchoate alliance of scholars, lawyers, activists and journalists seeking to upend a four-decade-long consensus of light-touch antitrust enforcement. Their hope was to replace it with the century-old, tough-on-big-business spirit of Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era crusader turned Supreme Court Justice. Near the end of the article, Ms. Khan observed: “To what degree this intellectual movement influences the U.S. competition regime in the coming years is an open question.”\n",
       "Today, the answer is clearer than the upstarts could have imagined. They now find themselves at the center of the debate. Ms. Khan, 32, is the new head of one of Washington’s two antitrust enforcement arms, the Federal Trade Commission that Brandeis helped to create in 1914. President Biden has nominated another neo-Brandeisian, Jonathan Kanter, 48, to head the other key enforcer, the Justice Department’s antitrust division. White House competition policy is handled by Tim Wu, 49, who wrote a 2018 book advocating a Brandeis restoration.\n",
       "They still face an uphill battle to enact their agenda, but it’s a remarkable advance for a movement that didn’t even have a name a few years ago. It underscores Mr. Biden’s intention, as he puts it, to “change the paradigm” in economic policy, repudiating the records not only of recent Republican presidents but of Democrats as well. Just as Donald Trump ripped up decades of bipartisan consensus on trade and globalization, Mr. Biden has assembled a team attempting to transform how the federal government deals with big business. In siding with the neo-Brandeisians, he has passed over experienced Democratic antitrust experts who cast the new ideology as a reckless experiment that, as one Clinton-Obama veteran says, “will slow economic growth and harm consumers.”\n",
       "Much of what animates the New Brandeis movement is the rise of big tech. Its advocates believe that the dominant, winner-take-all platforms of Google,\n",
       "Amazon ,\n",
       "Facebook\n",
       "and Apple are reminiscent of the interlocking, network-like behemoths that fostered the original antitrust movement: the railroads, the banks, Standard Oil and\n",
       "U.S. Steel .\n",
       "To Ms. Khan and her colleagues, the threat posed by the new giants requires dusting off old trust-busting strategies. If the neo-Brandeisians get their way, the federal government would challenge more mergers and business tactics and break up more companies.\n",
       "But the shift is about more than big tech and tougher enforcement. It’s about a change in the underlying philosophy of how Washington has governed corporate America since the 1980s. The new framework is more rooted in social and political goals than economic ones; more focused on the size of companies per se, less on trying to assess whether that size is good or bad for the economy; and more sympathetic to suppliers, small business and workers, even at the expense of consumers.\n",
